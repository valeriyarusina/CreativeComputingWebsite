        <h3> Big Red Gifts: </h3>
        <p>
      Last semester one of our teams created a full stack web application for
      campus-wide gift exchange by using Node.js and React frameworks.
      The program considered participantsâ€™ personal interests as well as local
       address for successful matching. We deployed the program in late November,
        and multiple students from different years and majors were able to exchange
        their christmas gifts and spread holiday spirit on campus.</p>
