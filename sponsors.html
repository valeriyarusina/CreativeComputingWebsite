<h2> WHY SPONSOR US</h2>
<p>The goal of our club is to provide students with an opportunity to work on meaningful
  and innovative projects in the intersection of art and technology. </p>
<p>  Our initiatives allow Cornell students to explore topics of their interests,
    work on new challenges with their teammates, and obtain experience of making
    products with enhanced interactivity and high-quality user-experience. </p>
<p> By becoming a sponsor of our club, you will have an opportunity to educate a new
generation of engineers, designers, and innovators. You will be able to
establish stronger presence on Cornell's campus through collaborative workshops, campaigns,
 and presentations on the latest technology trends. Our club will also work with you to
 incorporate your company's logo into our apparel and products to appreciate
 your contributions to the club and the whole Cornell community. </p>

<p> If you are interested in becoming our partner, just reach out to one of our officers
 by email, and we will be in touch with you soon.</p>
